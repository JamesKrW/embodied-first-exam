# MetaWorld+ · basketball — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service)

A **Sawyer** arm stands at a table: Meta-World's `basketball-v3` environment (MuJoCo). **Task: Pick up the ball and place it through the basketball hoop.**
The scene is one frozen instance of Meta-World's own randomization.

You control the robot **as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one
client and one episode.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** What you knock over stays knocked over.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, optional depth, with each camera's calibration), the
  robot's own state and the task's target point. No object poses, no success signal.
- Your only budget is the time limit (`## Time limit`). `meta["time_left_s"]` is the service's count of it, from your first
  request to the service: it never runs out before your time does, so plan by it. There is nothing to hand in: the
  service records the episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at `/app/output/gen.py` for the
  record.
- Do not use Meta-World's scripted policies or any published solution for this benchmark; write your own controller.
- Images come back as arrays in a Python object; what you look at and where you store it is up to your code.

## Scoring
The episode runs until your time is up. The service then applies Meta-World's own success check for `basketball-v3` to the
live episode's state **after the last executed control step**. A success reached earlier and then lost does not count:
end in the state you want graded and stop submitting.

For `basketball-v3` the check is: The ball's centre is within 8 cm of the point that has the target point's x and y and the height z = 0.30 m, with the height difference counted double. ("The target point" is `meta["task"]["target_pos"]`; everything the
check needs to hold must hold in that final state.)

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.1`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects (waits while the service starts)
spec = r.spec()                               # control_dt, action layout + limits, cameras, proprio layout, budget
cams = list(spec["cameras"])                  # front, left, right, topview
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=cams, include_depth=True)   # obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (240, 320, 3); obs.depth[cam] -> metres
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [...], "now": [...]}
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per camera: intrinsic_cv, cam2world_gl (OpenGL: looks along -z)
obs.meta["task"]["target_pos"]                # the task's target point (world frame)
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=cams[:1], seconds=2.0, video="mp4")    # hold still and watch for 2 s (max 30)
res = r.submit("ee_delta", A, dt=spec["control_dt"], cameras=cams[:1], video="mp4")   # A: (T, 4)
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["control_steps"]
res.video[cam]; res.frames[cam]; res.last[cam]; res.proprio; res.save("/app/runs/003")
```
- Action `ee_delta` (4: `dx, dy, dz, grip`, float64, each clipped to [-1, 1]) is Meta-World's native action, applied
  once per control step (`control_dt` = 0.0125 s). The hand's target moves by `[dx, dy, dz]` × 1 cm per control step
  and stays inside x ∈ [-0.5, 0.5], y ∈ [0.4, 1], z ∈ [0.05, 0.5]; the hand follows it. `grip` drives the two fingers (+1 closes, -1 opens). The wrist does
  not rotate. Rows are `dt` apart (a multiple of `control_dt`); with `dt = control_dt` each row is one native action.
  A chunk covers at most 10 s.
- `get_obs(seconds=s)` holds the hand still (zero motion, same grip) while physics runs for `s` seconds; those control
  steps are part of the episode.
- Proprioception (`meta["proprio"]["layout"]`): `tcp_x/y/z` (the point between the fingertips), `gripper_opening`
  (0 closed … 1 open), `mocap_x/y/z` (the hand's target), the arm joints' positions and velocities, the finger joints'
  positions, and `cmd_*` (the last action).
- World frame: metres; x to the robot's right, y forward (away from the robot's base), z up; the table top is at z = 0. Quaternions are w x y z. The four cameras are fixed.
- Calibration: `meta["cameras"][cam]` holds `intrinsic_cv` (pinhole, pixels) and `cam2world_gl` (4x4 camera-to-world,
  OpenGL axes: x right, y up, the camera looks along -z; the viewpoint the image is rendered from). Depth is the
  distance along the viewing axis, in metres.

One call returns at most 3000 images (`max_frames_per_call`, PROTOCOL §3 "Images per call").

## This run: privileged state queries

This run lets you query the simulator's state. This section overrides anything above, and anything in `/spec`, that
says object poses or the scene's state are never given.

- `GET /state/entities` (on the same base URL as your other calls) lists what you can query:
  `{"frame": ..., "quaternion_order": ..., "entities": {name: {"kind": ..., "fields": {field: unit}}}}`. The
  kinds are `robot` (the robot's base or root), `robot_link` (a hand, a foot, an end effector), `object`,
  `articulation` (a door, a drawer, a faucet: its joints) and `scene_feature` (a zone, a line, a hazard, a canvas
  region). The list is fixed for the run.
- `POST /state/query` with `{"names": ["robot", ...], "fields": ["pos", "quat"]}` answers JSON
  `{"state": {name: {field: value}}, "control_steps": ..., "sim_time_s": ..., "state_queries": ...}` with the
  current values. `fields` is optional: without it you get every field of each name. In Python:
  `requests.post(base + "/state/query", json={"names": ["robot"]}).json()["state"]`.
  - The usual fields: `pos` [x, y, z] m, `quat` (in `quaternion_order`), `lin_vel` m/s, `ang_vel` rad/s,
    `height_above_ground` m, `joint_pos` / `joint_vel` {joint: value}, `size` [3] m (full extents), and `bbox`
    [[min x, y, z], [max x, y, z]] m. A task may add its own; each field's unit is in the list.
  - All values are in the world frame that `frame` describes.
  - A field that an entity does not have is left out of its entry.
  - An unknown name or field is a 400 that lists the valid ones.
- A query only reads. It takes no control step, and it does not advance or pause the clock. In standard-realtime it
  answers at the current simulation time while the robot keeps moving. It is served while the episode runs (409 after
  the episode ended). Queries are counted and recorded; they do not change the grading.
- Nothing else changes: the goal, the success rule and its thresholds are not given, and no answer says whether the
  task is done.

## This run: unlimited resets, save and load

This run changes the reset budget and adds two calls. This section overrides anything above, and anything in `/spec`,
that says there is no reset, one episode only, or fewer resets.

- You have 1000 resets (`spec()["budget"]["reset"]` is 1000): in practice as many as your time allows.
- `POST /reset` on the same base URL as your other calls (`http://sim:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`), with a JSON body
  such as `{"cameras": []}` (in Python, for example `requests.post(base + "/reset", json={"cameras": []})`; the
  client's `_post("/reset", {"cameras": []}, [], 60)` where it has no `reset()`). It abandons the running episode, or
  follows one that has ended (a failure or a fall included), and starts a new episode from the same starting state.
  The answer carries the new episode's first frames; `meta` and `GET /status` add `episode`, `resets_left`, `saves`,
  `loads` and `control_steps_total`.
- Where `/spec` has `state_ops`, two more calls exist (its text is the full rule):
  - `POST /save_state` with `{}` stores the current state in the service and answers JSON
    `{"handle": "s1", "step": ...}`. The handle is all you get, never the state's contents.
  - `POST /load_state` with `{"handle": "s1", "cameras": []}` restores a state saved earlier in this run and starts a
    new episode there; it answers as `/reset` does. At most 32 handles are kept (the least recently used one is
    dropped). Saves and loads do not use up resets.
  Where `/spec` has no `state_ops`, this task offers resets only.
- Your time keeps running across resets and loads (in standard-realtime the robot's clock pauses after a reset or a
  load until your next command).
- Only the last episode is graded: from the starting state, or for a loaded episode the path that led to the saved
  state followed by what you did after the load. The success rule is checked again from your next command on. A
  success still ends the run: no reset, save or load after it.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resources
Your container: **2 CPUs**, **5 GiB of memory**, **1024 processes and threads** and **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`). Your container has no GPU. The simulator runs in its own container and does not count against these. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 1800 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).
