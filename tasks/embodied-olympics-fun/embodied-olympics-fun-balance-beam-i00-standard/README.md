| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution; the referee is tested: positive by injection (the robot slid along the 10 cm beam in its tandem pose, 4 mm per step); negatives: `stand` mode (off in 1.5 s), the walking policy (off in 0.5 s), stopping short, past the end, lying on it, beside it. The tandem hold on joint targets is stable; a real walk on a 10 cm beam was not attempted; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §4) |

## Task
Walk along the balance beam from the end you stand on to the other end and stand there, without anything touching the floor. (Embodied Olympics `balance-beam`; the robot as a service: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
The beam is 0.1 m wide and the robot's built-in stance and gait keep the feet 0.24 m apart, so neither can be used: every step is a single-leg balance on a sole 0.07 m wide, 1.25 m above the floor, for 5.0 m. In standard mode the agent has no simulator and no state: it sees through the robot's cameras, acts through the client, and has 5 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
None (as `embodied-olympics-fun-balance-beam-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar's referee judges the live attempt, and that is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0;
no grading replay, owner 2026-10-17); the frozen start is checked on the live simulator (`instance_mismatch`:
infrastructure), and the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards. `/tests/grade.py` reads
`/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The
rules: The beam is a competition balance beam: 5.0 m long, 0.1 m wide on top and 0.16 m deep, its top 1.25 m above the floor; it runs along +x from x = 0 to x = 5.0 m, centred on y = 0, on two supports. You must get from the end you start on to the far end on your feet. The far end is the last 0.5 m of the beam. You succeed when both feet are on the beam with every point at which they touch it inside the far end, and you then stand there for 2.0 s without a break: only your feet touch the beam, your torso is within 20.0 degrees of vertical and your pelvis moves slower than 0.35 m/s. You fail the moment any part of you touches the floor or the beam's supports (a fall from the beam), the moment any part of you other than a foot touches the beam (a fall on the beam: no hands, knees or sitting), or after 90 s. Leaving the beam with both feet (a hop) is allowed as long as you come down on it on your feet. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §4).

## Resources
Each number is an upper bound for one container; docs/protocol/README.md §6 says where each is set and what enforces it.

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 10 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | 20 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 8 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | — |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: estimated on an RTX 4090 workstation: CPU only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client

| Rule book | FIG Apparatus Norms (Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique), women's artistic gymnastics, balance beam: length 5.00 m, width of the top 0.10 m, depth of the beam body 0.16 m, top 1.25 m above the floor; FIG Code of Points, women's artistic gymnastics: a beam exercise lasts at most 1 min 30 s; deviations: FIG Apparatus Norms, balance beam (padding): the beam is rigid with a friction coefficient of 1.0, without the norm's thin elastic padding and suede cover, because the simulator has rigid bodies only · FIG Apparatus Norms, landing mats: there are no 0.20 m mats round the beam; the floor is 1.25 m below the top, because anything touching the floor ends the attempt anyway · FIG Code of Points (a routine is scored, a fall costs 1.00): one pass along the beam is judged pass or fail, because the task is a single action; a hand or any part other than a foot on the beam counts as a fall here |
