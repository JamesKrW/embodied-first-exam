| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution; the referee is tested: positive by injection (the robot laid prone, 0.27 m high, and dragged under the 21 wires by a force on the pelvis); negatives: walking upright into a wire, on hands and knees (0.46 m: a wire touched), round, over, not under, stopping inside. No crawling controller exists; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §4) |

## Task
Get under the low wires in front of you and crawl the whole course until your whole body is beyond the last wire, without touching a wire. (Embodied Olympics `crawl`; the robot as a service: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
Neither built-in gait works below 0.45 m, and on hands and knees this robot is about 0.46 m high, just too tall: it has to get down from standing and move 10.0 m and its own length flat on the ground with joint commands of its own, never lifting any part into a wire. In standard mode the agent has no simulator and no state: it sees through the robot's cameras, acts through the client, and has 5 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
None (as `embodied-olympics-fun-crawl-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar's referee judges the live attempt, and that is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0;
no grading replay, owner 2026-10-17); the frozen start is checked on the live simulator (`instance_mismatch`:
infrastructure), and the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards. `/tests/grade.py` reads
`/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The
rules: The obstacle is a lane along +x, 2.0 m wide between two rows of posts, centred on y = 0. Horizontal wires cross it every 0.5 m over 10.0 m: the first is 1.0 m ahead of where your pelvis starts, the last 10.0 m further on. Each wire is 0.008 m thick with its centre 0.45 m above the ground. You succeed when your whole body (every part of you) is beyond the last wire, having passed under all of them. There is no fall rule: any part of you may touch the ground, and you need not stand up at the end. You fail the moment any part of you touches a wire; if your pelvis, while it is between the first and the last wire, is higher than 0.45 m (going over) or outside the lane (going round, beyond a row of posts); if your whole body is beyond the last wire without your pelvis having passed under the wires; or after 120 s. The posts may be touched. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §4).

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 10 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 6 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | — |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: estimated on an RTX 4090 workstation: CPU only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client

| Category | parkour-apparatus-balance |
| Rule book | No federation rule book: the low-wire crawl of military obstacle courses and obstacle-course racing (wires strung about 18 in, 0.45 m, above the ground; the athlete passes under all of them and may not go round or over). The layout is this benchmark's: wires every 0.5 m over 10 m; deviations: the wires: each wire is a rigid, fixed bar 8 mm thick between two posts, not a slack (barbed) wire, because the simulator has rigid bodies only; touching one fails the attempt, as a judge's fault for a snagged wire · the ground: level and rigid with a friction coefficient of 1.0, not sand or mud, because the simulator's ground is rigid |
| Stages | under the first wire → half way → through |
| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the Embodied Olympics adapter) on `rcb_service.py` (eai-standard/2.1), `rcb_rfo.py`, `rfo/`, `rfo_task.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Observations | `head_left`, `head_right` (RGB 270 × 480, depth on `head_left`), `venue` (fixed); proprioception: joints, torques, targets, two IMUs, grip state |
| Episode | 12000 control steps (120 s at 100 Hz); 5 resets, the last attempt graded |
| Network | open: agents may search for and download public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (owner, 2026-10-11; tasks/embodied-olympics-fun/README.md) |
