## Task
Standard-mode twin of `molmospaces-pick-i00-privileged` (the same frozen MolmoSpaces episode): Pick up the pie. The agent gets only the
`eai-standard/2.2` client (docs/protocol/standard_mode.md); the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar
(`environment/docker-compose.yaml`), which owns the episode, serves cameras, proprioception and upstream's kinematic
model, and records every executed row. The collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the episode, lets the
service exit and writes `final.json` from the live episode's result (nothing is replayed to grade it), then renders
`replay.mp4`; the verifier grades those artifacts in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`).

## Difficulty
That of `molmospaces-pick-i00-privileged` (its README), without resets, object poses or a success check: every move is planned from camera
images, depth and the robot's own proprioception, within the benchmark's 20 s of simulated time.

## Reference solution
None is shipped (see `molmospaces-pick-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
`success` = the live episode's success, judged by the sim service (graded live, no replay: 2026-10-17). The episode
follows upstream's evaluation: one upstream `Task.step` per executed row; it ends at upstream's `is_done()`
(303 control steps), at the agent's `done`, or when the agent's time is up; then upstream's
`judge_success()` on the final state: the object touches the robot and nothing else, and it is at least 1 cm higher than where it started. The service checks the frozen start (the instance's t = 0 state hash)
when it builds the scene, before the agent is served. `replay.mp4` is rendered by one video-only pass from
`trajectory.npz` after the verdict, which it never changes. `infra_error = 1` (no verdict on the agent): no, an
unreadable or an unfinished `final.json`, a service that gave up after crashes between calls or never ended the
episode, a frozen start the image no longer builds (`instance_mismatch`). No oracle; human review in PR #276 (PROTOCOL §4: per family, this task
and its twin, a positive example and the `nop` result).

## Resources
Each number is an upper bound for one container; docs/protocol/README.md §6 says where each is set and what enforces it.

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 8 | 16 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | 20 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 12 GiB | 8192 | 7 GiB | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 8 | 16 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 20 GiB |

- GPU: any NVIDIA GPU, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: any 8 GB+ NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4090 / L4 / L40S).
- Measured: GPU memory 2.7 GB on an L40S (per-trial peaks of past trials); memory and CPU estimated (MuJoCo, CPU physics, EGL rendering)
- Measured (caps): GPU memory (the sim service): a per-trial peak of 2.7 GiB on a 48 GB card -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4), rounded up: 7 GiB; one trial on a 24 GB card read 18.4 GiB, above the cap (a whole-trial reading on that card, not split by container, so which container held it is not recorded); processes and disk: defaults, not measured
