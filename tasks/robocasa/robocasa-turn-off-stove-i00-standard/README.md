## Task
Standard mode (robot as a service, `eai-standard/2.1`) of `robocasa-turn-off-stove-i00-privileged`: the same frozen instance and success check, served by the `sim` sidecar (`embodied_first_exam/benchmarks/robocasa/sim/server_casa.py`, tool module `casa_tool`), which records the episode and judges it live (nothing is replayed); the verifier grades the sidecar's record in a container of its own. The agent sees the robot's cameras (RGB-D, calibrated), its own joints and end effector, and the instruction.

## Difficulty
The agent has to find the fixtures and objects in the robot's camera images, drive a mobile manipulator with its native controller, and finish in one episode without a reset.

## Reference solution
`solution/`: the privileged reference's 247 actions submitted through the client, one row per control step.

## Verification
The sim service judges the live episode when the agent's time is up (the environment's success check on the state after the last executed control step; nothing is replayed) and writes the verdict, final at once; `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) reads its `final.json` (`graded_by = live`): `success = live_success ∧ not solved at the start ∧ no simulator error`. The episode's start is checked against the frozen instance before the agent is served (`RCB_INSTANCE_SHA`, `RCB_START_SHA`; a mismatch is an infrastructure failure, `instance_mismatch`). The video is rendered from the trajectory after the verdict (one render pass) and never decides it.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 2 | 5 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 5 | 15 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | — |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: memory: robosuite sim p90 9.7 GB (RoboCasa and RoboCasa-GR1 together; a per-container memory sampler); CPU only (OSMesa cameras); CPU: an estimate
- Measured (caps): per-container peaks in 26 past trials: the agent's container memory 2.2 GiB, 205 threads, CPU 1.5 cores, disk 2.2 GiB; the sim service memory 9.7 GiB, 192 threads, CPU 4.8 cores
