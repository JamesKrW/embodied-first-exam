## Task
Standard mode (robot as a service, `eai-standard/2.1`) of `robocasa-gr1-cuttingboard-to-pot-i00-privileged`: the same frozen instance and success check, served by the `sim` sidecar (`embodied_first_exam/benchmarks/robocasa/sim/server_casa.py`, tool module `casa_tool`), which records the episode and judges it live (nothing is replayed); the verifier grades the sidecar's record in a container of its own. The agent sees the robot's cameras (RGB-D, calibrated), its own joints and end effector, and the instruction.

## Difficulty
The agent has to find the objects in the humanoid's camera images, coordinate two arms and two dexterous hands through the IK controller, and finish in one episode without a reset.

## Reference solution
`solution/`: the privileged reference's 153 actions submitted through the client, one row per control step.

## Verification
The sim service judges the live episode when the agent's time is up (the environment's success check on the state after the last executed control step; nothing is replayed) and writes the verdict, final at once; `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) reads its `final.json` (`graded_by = live`): `success = live_success ∧ not solved at the start ∧ no simulator error`. The episode's start is checked against the frozen instance before the agent is served (`RCB_INSTANCE_SHA`, `RCB_START_SHA`; a mismatch is an infrastructure failure, `instance_mismatch`). The video is rendered from the trajectory after the verdict (one render pass) and never decides it.

## Resources
Each number is an upper bound for one container; docs/protocol/README.md §6 says where each is set and what enforces it.

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 16 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | 20 GiB |
| `sim` | 6 | 14 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | — |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: memory: robosuite sim p90 9.7 GB (RoboCasa and RoboCasa-GR1 together; a per-container memory sampler); CPU only (OSMesa cameras); CPU: an estimate
- Measured (caps): processes and disk: defaults, not measured
