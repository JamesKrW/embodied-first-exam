## Task
ABC Sim `put_plastic_bottles_in_bin` (two I2RT YAM arms (6 revolute joints and a parallel two-finger gripper each) side by side at the near edge of a table, facing +x (the left arm is the one at +y)): Put the 2 plastic bottles into the bin. Success: all 2 bottles are inside the bin at the same time: each bottle's centre of mass within the bin's inner radius of its axis (the bin widens towards the top), not below its floor, and at most about one bottle length above its rim (a bottle may still be held). The goal must hold for 30 consecutive control steps (1.02 s); the episode then ends in success.
2 plastic bottles stand or lie on the table next to a tub-shaped bin (a loose object). The robot is a service; the episode it runs is graded.

## Difficulty
First-pass rating: medium. Grasping and placing light bottles of different shapes into a bin that can slide or tip; the bottles roll when they are knocked. The action is joint-level (two 6-joint arms and two grippers; no motion primitives), and the goal has to hold, so passing through it does not count.

## Reference solution
The privileged twin's reference (the commanded actions of one of upstream's validation demonstrations of this task): `solution/oracle.npy`, 476 rows, streamed as `joint_position` chunks through the client (`solution/oracle_stream.py`); the service executes exactly those rows and ends at the same state as the privileged replay.

## Verification
The live episode's verdict (PROTOCOL H.4): the sim sidecar judges the episode it ran by the task's rule (the 1.02 s hold included) and the collect hook (`/opt/abc-tools/standard/finalize.sh`) writes it to `final.json`; the verifier (the shared `v2_1/grade.py`) transcribes it. Nothing is replayed to grade it; the video is rendered from the trajectory afterwards. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.

## Resources

|---|---|
| Upstream | ABC Sim, `abc_sim` of github.com/amazon-far/abc @ d0832d1 (Apache-2.0; assets CC BY 4.0 / MIT), on MuJoCo 3.6.0 |
| Instance | the scene of one of upstream's validation demonstrations (its assembled scene XML, initial qpos and randomization record); the model-side state its randomizer sets outside the XML written into the scene; state hash `9caab7a4776d5af8`, checked on every load |
| Actions | 14 joint-position targets per control step (0.034 s, 17 physics substeps of 2 ms) |
| Success | the upstream evaluator `put_plastic_bottles_in_bin` held 30 control steps |

### Provenance
The frozen instance (`instance.npz`) and the reference solution (`solution/oracle.npy`) were made at generation time from
an upstream validation demonstration; see `tasks/abc-sim/README.md`.
