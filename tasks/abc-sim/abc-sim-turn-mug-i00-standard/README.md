## Task
ABC Sim `turn_mug_right_side_up` (two I2RT YAM arms (6 revolute joints and a parallel two-finger gripper each) side by side at the near edge of a table, facing +x (the left arm is the one at +y)): Turn every mug right side up. Success: every mug stands upright (its axis within 18 deg of vertical, opening up) with its centre no more than 0.03 m higher than where it started (set back down). The goal must hold for 30 consecutive control steps (1.02 s); the episode then ends in success.
2 mugs stand upside down on a tray on the table. The robot is a service; the episode it runs is graded.

## Difficulty
First-pass rating: medium. Re-grasping: a mug standing upside down has to be lifted, turned over (in one hand, by a hand-over, or by pivoting it) and set down upright. The action is joint-level (two 6-joint arms and two grippers; no motion primitives), and the goal has to hold, so passing through it does not count.

## Reference solution
The privileged twin's reference (the commanded actions of one of upstream's validation demonstrations of this task): `solution/oracle.npy`, 561 rows, streamed as `joint_position` chunks through the client (`solution/oracle_stream.py`); the service executes exactly those rows and ends at the same state as the privileged replay.

## Verification
The live episode's verdict (PROTOCOL H.4): the sim sidecar judges the episode it ran by the task's rule (the 1.02 s hold included) and the collect hook (`/opt/abc-tools/standard/finalize.sh`) writes it to `final.json`; the verifier (the shared `v2_1/grade.py`) transcribes it. Nothing is replayed to grade it; the video is rendered from the trajectory afterwards. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 10 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | 20 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 10 GiB | 8192 | 5 GiB | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 4 | 10 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 20 GiB |

- GPU: any NVIDIA GPU, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: any NVIDIA GPU with EGL (RTX 4090 / L4).
- Measured: oracle trials of all 60 directories on an RTX 4090 workstation (docker stats every 3 s, the trial's resource monitor): the sim sidecar 2.1 GB and 0.83 GiB of GPU memory (standard, chess; realtime 0.8 GB and 0.72 GiB), the agent's container (the client) 0.03 GB; the collect hook renders the video inside the sidecar (EGL)

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | ABC Sim, `abc_sim` of github.com/amazon-far/abc @ d0832d1 (Apache-2.0; assets CC BY 4.0 / MIT), on MuJoCo 3.6.0 |
| Instance | the scene of one of upstream's validation demonstrations (its assembled scene XML, initial qpos and randomization record); the model-side state its randomizer sets outside the XML written into the scene; state hash `daf231053bf05830`, checked on every load |
| Actions | 14 joint-position targets per control step (0.034 s, 17 physics substeps of 2 ms) |
| Success | the upstream evaluator `turn_mug_right_side_up` held 30 control steps |

### Provenance
The frozen instance (`instance.npz`) and the reference solution (`solution/oracle.npy`) were made at generation time from
an upstream validation demonstration; see `tasks/abc-sim/README.md`.
