## Task
ABC Sim `inhand_transfer_item_to_other_side` (two I2RT YAM arms (6 revolute joints and a parallel two-finger gripper each) side by side at the near edge of a table, facing +x (the left arm is the one at +y)): Hand the cream cheese stick over to the other side: pick it up with the right arm, pass it to the other gripper and put it down on the left (+y) half. Success: the cream cheese stick's centre is at least 0.10 m past the middle line between the two arms, on the left arm's side, no more than 0.10 m above the table top, and over the table (the hand-over itself is not checked). The goal must hold for 30 consecutive control steps (1.02 s); the episode then ends in success.
A cream cheese stick lies on the right (-y) half of the table, on its arm's side. The robot is a service; the episode it runs is graded.

## Difficulty
First-pass rating: medium. A hand-over between two grippers in mid-air, with the object's pose in the grasp known only from the cameras (standard modes). The action is joint-level (two 6-joint arms and two grippers; no motion primitives), and the goal has to hold, so passing through it does not count.

## Reference solution
The privileged twin's reference (the commanded actions of one of upstream's validation demonstrations of this task): `solution/oracle.npy`, 374 rows, streamed as `joint_position` chunks through the client (`solution/oracle_stream.py`); the service executes exactly those rows and ends at the same state as the privileged replay.

## Verification
The live episode's verdict (PROTOCOL H.4): the sim sidecar judges the episode it ran by the task's rule (the 1.02 s hold included) and the collect hook (`/opt/abc-tools/standard/finalize.sh`) writes it to `final.json`; the verifier (the shared `v2_1/grade.py`) transcribes it. Nothing is replayed to grade it; the video is rendered from the trajectory afterwards. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.

|---|---|
| Upstream | ABC Sim, `abc_sim` of github.com/amazon-far/abc @ d0832d1 (Apache-2.0; assets CC BY 4.0 / MIT), on MuJoCo 3.6.0 |
| Instance | the scene of one of upstream's validation demonstrations (its assembled scene XML, initial qpos and randomization record); the model-side state its randomizer sets outside the XML written into the scene; state hash `2fee35e343f1e9d5`, checked on every load |
| Actions | 14 joint-position targets per control step (0.034 s, 17 physics substeps of 2 ms) |
| Success | the upstream evaluator `inhand_transfer_item_to_other_side` held 30 control steps |

### Provenance
The frozen instance (`instance.npz`) and the reference solution (`solution/oracle.npy`) were made at generation time from
an upstream validation demonstration; see `tasks/abc-sim/README.md`.
