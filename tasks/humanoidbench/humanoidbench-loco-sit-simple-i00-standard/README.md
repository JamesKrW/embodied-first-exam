| Mode | standard (`eai-standard/2.1`) |
| Twin | `humanoidbench-loco-sit-simple-i00-privileged` |
| Simulator / robot | `humanoidbench` / `unitree-h1` |

## Task
Standard mode (robot as a service, `eai-standard/2.1`) of `humanoidbench-loco-sit-simple-i00-privileged`: the
same frozen instance and the same success rule. HumanoidBench runs in the `sim` sidecar
(`environment/docker-compose.yaml`, GPU on the sidecar for rendering), which holds the reward, judges the
episode as it runs, records it and, after the verdict, renders its video from the recorded trajectory; the
verifier grades the sidecar's record in a container of its own (`tests/Dockerfile`, no network).

Note: the chair is behind the robot and never enters the head cameras' view (floor and horizon only);
`room_camera` (the recording camera frozen at its starting pose) sees both.

## Difficulty
See `humanoidbench-loco-sit-simple-i00-privileged`'s README; here the agent also has no state, no reward and
no simulator of its own, and 50 resets instead of unlimited ones: every try is a real episode on the one
robot.

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_replay.py` sends the same 999 rows (`solution/sit_simple_actions.npy`) through the client,
one per control step (`dt` = 0.02 s, `interpolate="hold"`), as an agent would send them; the service ends the
episode the moment the return reaches the pass mark. No privileged information at run time.

## Verification
`success` = live success: the episode the sim service ran reached the pass mark (HumanoidBench's own rule,
judged on the live simulator; the episode ends there), for the last episode (the one after the last reset;
earlier episodes are in `trajectory_live.f64` and `episode.jsonl`, not graded). Nothing is replayed to grade
it (owner, 2026-10-17). The scene's start is checked against the frozen instance's recorded state
when an episode begins (a mismatch is `instance_mismatch`, infrastructure). `tests/grade.py` reads
`/data/final.json` and copies the evidence to `/logs/verifier/`: `trajectory.npz` (the deliverable,
replayable) and `replay.mp4`, rendered from it in one pass after the verdict (a lost video never changes the
verdict). The oracle (`solution/solve.sh`) scores 1; `nop` scores 0.

## Resources
Each number is an upper bound for one container; docs/protocol/README.md §6 says where each is set and what enforces it.

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 16 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | 20 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 7 GiB | 8192 | 7 GiB | — |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: any NVIDIA GPU, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: any 8 GB+ NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4090 / L4).
- Measured: GPU memory 1.1-2.3 GB (per-trial peaks of past trials); memory: sim 0.7 GB (a per-container memory sampler); CPU: an estimate
- Measured (caps): GPU memory (the sim service): a per-trial peak of 2.3 GiB -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4), rounded up: 7 GiB; processes and disk: defaults, not measured

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| mode / sensors | standard: head-camera RGB + joint angles and velocities (HumanoidBench's own `image` and `proprio` sensors), a pelvis IMU and a camera fixed in the room; no root pose, no chair pose, no reward; 50 resets (a new episode from the frozen start each; only the last episode is graded) |
| action space | HumanoidBench's own: 19 normalised position targets, 50 Hz, sent in chunks |
| knobs (compose env) | `RCB_RESET_BUDGET` (50: HumanoidBench's standard configuration, tasks/humanoidbench/README.md), `RCB_OBS_PROPRIO` (1), `RCB_OBS_IMU` (1), `RCB_OBS_ROOM_CAMERA` (1), `RCB_OBS_DEPTH` (0): the defaults are the standard configuration; a run that changes one (`RCB_RESET_BUDGET=0 harbor run ...`: one episode, no reset) is reported separately, and `episode.jsonl` records the `/spec` it ran under |
| agent API | `environment/rcb_client.py` (its docstring is the reference); `instruction.md` lists the endpoints |
| physics vs upstream | upstream's model (HumanoidBench cb11890) on MuJoCo 3.3.7, not the 3.1.6 upstream pins, whose convex collision reported wrong contacts; results on image 0.1.6 or earlier are other physics and are reported apart (tasks/humanoidbench/README.md, Physics). |
