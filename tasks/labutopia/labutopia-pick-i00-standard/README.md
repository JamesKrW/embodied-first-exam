## Task
LabUtopia's `pick` (Pick) on the same frozen instance as `labutopia-pick-i00-privileged`: Pick up the glass conical flask that stands on the bench and hold it up. Success the moment the flask's centre has been more than 10 cm above where it stood for one second (60 control steps in a row).
On the bench in front of the arm: one glass conical (Erlenmeyer) flask, about 9.5 cm across at its base and 17 cm tall. Standard mode (eai-standard/2.2): the agent drives the robot through a client in one episode, with only its proprioception and the scene's cameras.

## Difficulty
Same instance and success rule as `labutopia-pick-i00-privileged` (LabUtopia's level 1). The flask is glass (nearly transparent in the cameras) and conical: the gripper closes on a wall that narrows upwards, and the flask has to stay in the grip for a full second 10 cm up. In standard mode the agent loses resets, the simulator and the state of the objects: it sees camera images (glassware is nearly transparent in them and absent from the depth maps) and the robot's proprioception, acts in joint target chunks, and gets one episode, so it has to find the things it handles in the images and recover from its own mistakes without starting over.

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_stream.py` streams the privileged reference's rows (`solution/oracle.npz`, 478 rows, float32) through the client as `joint_position_velocity` chunks; it uses no privileged information at run time. The service's recorded trajectory is then exactly the privileged reference: success after 478 control steps.

## Verification
Graded by the live episode (docs/protocol/README.md H.4): `success` = the live episode's success, judged by the sim service on the episode the agent ran, with no grading replay; an episode that ended in a simulator error scores 0. The service records every executed control step; the collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the service, writes `final.json` from the live episode's record and, after the verdict is on disk, replays the recorded trajectory once from the frozen instance to render `replay.mp4` (a failed video replay costs the video only). `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) writes the reward fields (`graded_by_live` = 1, `replays` = 0, `infra_error`, the crash-recovery fields). A missing or unfinished `final.json` (the hook never wrote its verdict) and a live episode that did not start in the instance's recorded state are `infra_error = 1`, never the agent's 0. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.

## Resources
Each number is an upper bound for one container; docs/protocol/README.md §6 says where each is set and what enforces it.

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 8 | 32 GiB | 16384 | no GPU | 20 GiB |
| `sim` | 16 | 24 GiB | 16384 | 16 GiB | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 8 | 32 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 20 GiB |

- GPU: an RTX-class NVIDIA GPU (ray-tracing cores), one of the models in `gpu_types`: RTX 4090, L40S, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: RTX 4090 24GB / L40S 48GB.
- Measured: oracle checks on an RTX 4090, lab_001 pick: the rendering container peaks at 17 GB of memory, about 7 GB of GPU memory, 8 CPUs (start-up bursts to 16 cores for about 70 s); lab_003 families 21 GB at the peak (on an 8 vCPU host)
- Measured (caps): GPU memory (the sim service): about 7 GiB in the oracle on an RTX 4090 -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4), at least 16 GiB for Isaac Sim: 16 GiB; processes and disk: defaults, not measured
