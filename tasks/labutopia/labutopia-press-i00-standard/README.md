## Task
LabUtopia's `press` (Press) on the same frozen instance as `labutopia-press-i00-privileged`: Press the red button on the instrument's front panel (the two grey buttons next to it do not count) and keep it pressed. Success the moment its cap has been pushed in more than 5 mm for one second (60 control steps in a row). The panel is vertical and faces the arm: the button is pushed in along the forward (+x) axis of the arm's base.
In front of the arm stands an instrument with a vertical front panel that carries three square buttons in a row, each 8 cm across: one red, two dark grey. Standard mode (eai-standard/2.2): the agent drives the robot through a client in one episode, with only its proprioception and the scene's cameras.

## Difficulty
Same instance and success rule as `labutopia-press-i00-privileged` (LabUtopia's level 1). The target is one of three identical buttons told apart by colour only, on a vertical panel at arm's length; it has to be held in for a full second. In standard mode the agent loses resets, the simulator and the state of the objects: it sees camera images (glassware is nearly transparent in them and absent from the depth maps) and the robot's proprioception, acts in joint target chunks, and gets one episode, so it has to find the things it handles in the images and recover from its own mistakes without starting over.

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_stream.py` streams the privileged reference's rows (`solution/oracle.npz`, 328 rows, float32) through the client as `joint_position_velocity` chunks; it uses no privileged information at run time. The service's recorded trajectory is then exactly the privileged reference: success after 328 control steps.

## Verification
Graded by the live episode (docs/protocol/README.md H.4): `success` = the live episode's success, judged by the sim service on the episode the agent ran, with no grading replay; an episode that ended in a simulator error scores 0. The service records every executed control step; the collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the service, writes `final.json` from the live episode's record and, after the verdict is on disk, replays the recorded trajectory once from the frozen instance to render `replay.mp4` (a failed video replay costs the video only). `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) writes the reward fields (`graded_by_live` = 1, `replays` = 0, `infra_error`, the crash-recovery fields). A missing or unfinished `final.json` (the hook never wrote its verdict) and a live episode that did not start in the instance's recorded state are `infra_error = 1`, never the agent's 0. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 8 | 32 GiB | 16384 | no GPU | 20 GiB |
| `sim` | 16 | 32 GiB | 16384 | 16 GiB | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 8 | 32 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 20 GiB |

- GPU: an RTX-class NVIDIA GPU (ray-tracing cores), one of the models in `gpu_types`: RTX 4090, L40S, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: RTX 4090 24GB / L40S 48GB.
- Measured: oracle checks on an RTX 4090, lab_001 pick: the rendering container peaks at 17 GB of memory, about 7 GB of GPU memory, 8 CPUs (start-up bursts to 16 cores for about 70 s); lab_003 families 21 GB at the peak (on an 8 vCPU host)
- Measured (caps): GPU memory (the sim service): about 7 GiB in the oracle on an RTX 4090 -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4), at least 16 GiB for Isaac Sim: 16 GiB; processes and disk: defaults, not measured
