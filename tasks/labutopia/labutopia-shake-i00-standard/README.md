## Task
LabUtopia's `shake` (Shake (LabUtopia's level-2 ShakeBeaker is the same task)) on the same frozen instance as `labutopia-shake-i00-privileged`: Pick up the glass beaker, shake it, and hold it still. Nothing is counted while the beaker's centre is less than 5 cm above where it stood. Success the moment the second of these is met: (1) five times, the beaker's centre moves 5 cm or more (horizontally) from where it was when that count began; (2) after the fifth, the centre stays within 1 cm in each horizontal direction over one second (60 control steps in a row).
On the bench in front of the arm: one small glass beaker, about 6.5 cm across and 10 cm tall. Standard mode (eai-standard/2.2): the agent drives the robot through a client in one episode, with only its proprioception and the scene's cameras.

## Difficulty
Same instance and success rule as `labutopia-shake-i00-privileged` (LabUtopia's level 1). A small beaker has to survive five quick moves of 5 cm in the grip and then be held within 1 cm for a second: the grasp has to be firm enough for the accelerations. In standard mode the agent loses resets, the simulator and the state of the objects: it sees camera images (glassware is nearly transparent in them and absent from the depth maps) and the robot's proprioception, acts in joint target chunks, and gets one episode, so it has to find the things it handles in the images and recover from its own mistakes without starting over.

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_stream.py` streams the privileged reference's rows (`solution/oracle.npz`, 1087 rows, float32) through the client as `joint_position_velocity` chunks; it uses no privileged information at run time. The service's recorded trajectory is then exactly the privileged reference: success after 1087 control steps.

## Verification
Graded by the live episode (docs/protocol/README.md H.4): `success` = the live episode's success, judged by the sim service on the episode the agent ran, with no grading replay; an episode that ended in a simulator error scores 0. The service records every executed control step; the collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the service, writes `final.json` from the live episode's record and, after the verdict is on disk, replays the recorded trajectory once from the frozen instance to render `replay.mp4` (a failed video replay costs the video only). `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) writes the reward fields (`graded_by_live` = 1, `replays` = 0, `infra_error`, the crash-recovery fields). A missing or unfinished `final.json` (the hook never wrote its verdict) and a live episode that did not start in the instance's recorded state are `infra_error = 1`, never the agent's 0. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.
