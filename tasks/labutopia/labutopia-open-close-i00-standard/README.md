## Task
LabUtopia's `open_close` (OpenClose) on the same frozen instance as `labutopia-open-close-i00-privileged`: Open the top drawer of the cabinet (the upper of its two drawers), let go of it, then close it again and let go. Success the moment the second of these has held for one second (60 control steps in a row): (1) for one second, the drawer's handle is more than 13 cm from where it started, with the gripper more than 4 cm away from the handle (measured from the point between the fingertips to the handle's centre); (2) after that, the handle is more than 13 cm from where it was when (1) was met and nearer to where it started than it was then (pushed back, not pulled further out), again with the gripper more than 4 cm away.
On the bench in front of the arm: a grey cabinet with a white top, about 67 cm deep, 76 cm wide and 79 cm high: two drawers at the top, one above the other, each with a bar handle, and two doors below them. Everything is closed. Standard mode (eai-standard/2.2): the agent drives the robot through a client in one episode, with only its proprioception and the scene's cameras.

## Difficulty
Same instance and success rule as `labutopia-open-close-i00-privileged` (LabUtopia's level 2). Two manipulations of the same drawer in a row, each ending with the handle released for a second: pull it out more than 13 cm, then push it back more than 13 cm. In standard mode the agent loses resets, the simulator and the state of the objects: it sees camera images (glassware is nearly transparent in them and absent from the depth maps) and the robot's proprioception, acts in joint target chunks, and gets one episode, so it has to find the things it handles in the images and recover from its own mistakes without starting over.

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_stream.py` streams the privileged reference's rows (`solution/oracle.npz`, 1341 rows, float32) through the client as `joint_position_velocity` chunks; it uses no privileged information at run time. The service's recorded trajectory is then exactly the privileged reference: success after 1341 control steps.

## Verification
Graded by the live episode (docs/protocol/README.md H.4): `success` = the live episode's success, judged by the sim service on the episode the agent ran, with no grading replay; an episode that ended in a simulator error scores 0. The service records every executed control step; the collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the service, writes `final.json` from the live episode's record and, after the verdict is on disk, replays the recorded trajectory once from the frozen instance to render `replay.mp4` (a failed video replay costs the video only). `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) writes the reward fields (`graded_by_live` = 1, `replays` = 0, `infra_error`, the crash-recovery fields). A missing or unfinished `final.json` (the hook never wrote its verdict) and a live episode that did not start in the instance's recorded state are `infra_error = 1`, never the agent's 0. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.
