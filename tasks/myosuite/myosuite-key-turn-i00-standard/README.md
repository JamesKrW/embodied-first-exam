## Task
MyoSuite `myoHandKeyTurnFixed-v0` (MyoHand, 39 muscles) on the same frozen instance as `myosuite-key-turn-i00-privileged`: Turn the key held between the thumb and the index finger by more than 3.14 rad (half a turn). Success: the key's hinge angle above 3.14 rad for 50 consecutive control steps (1.0 s). Failure (the episode ends): the index or thumb tip more than 0.10 m from the key head.
The key sits in a lock in front of the palm; its head is between the thumb and the index finger. Standard mode (eai-standard/2.2): the agent drives the body through a client, with only its own proprioception and the scene's cameras, and 10 resets (only the last episode is graded).

## Difficulty
Same instance and success rule as `myosuite-key-turn-i00-privileged` (first-pass rating: medium). In standard mode the agent loses free resets, the simulator and the object state: it sees camera images and the limb's proprioception, acts in actuator-command chunks, and gets 10 resets, so it has to close the loop on what it sees and learn the body from a few real attempts.

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_stream.py` streams the privileged reference's rows (`solution/oracle.npy`, 72 rows, float32-exact) through the client in `hold` chunks; it uses no privileged information at run time. The service's recorded trajectory is then exactly the privileged reference: success after 72 control steps.

## Verification
The sim service judges the episode live (the task's rule on the steps it ran: the goal held 50 control steps) and records every executed control step; it checks at the episode's start that the scene is the frozen instance (its recorded state hash; else `instance_mismatch`, an infrastructure failure). The collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the service and writes that live verdict to `final.json` (`graded_by` = `live`; nothing is replayed to grade it), then renders `replay.mp4` in one pass over the recorded trajectory, which decides nothing; `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) passes iff the live episode succeeded. A missing or unreadable `final.json`, one without a verdict, or a give-up after crashes not all inside the agent's calls is an infrastructure failure (`infra_error = 1`), not the agent's 0. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 7 GiB | 2048 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 8 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 4 | 7 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 10 GiB |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: memory: sim p90 1.4 GB (a per-container memory sampler); CPU only; CPU: an estimate

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | MyoSuite 2.12.2 (Apache-2.0) on MuJoCo 3.6.0, the models that ship in its wheel |
| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the adapter) on the shared 2.2 layer `rcb_limited.py` (`embodied_first_exam/standard/`); cameras `side_view`, `front_view`, `hand_top`, `hand_bottom`, `hand_side_inter`, `hand_side_exter`, `plam_lookat` (640 x 480); forward kinematics of the body's links |
| Resources | 4 CPUs, no GPU (CPU physics, OSMesa rendering); after the agent's phase the collect hook only renders the video (one pass over the graded episode), it replays nothing to grade |
| Reset budget | 10 (`RCB_RESET_BUDGET`, compose default; PROTOCOL §2): `POST /reset` starts a new episode from the frozen instance; only the last episode is graded, a success ends the trial; results under another budget are reported separately |

### Provenance
The frozen instance (`environment/sim/instance.npz`), its scene facts and the reference solution (`solution/oracle.npy`) were made at generation time; see `tasks/myosuite/README.md`.
