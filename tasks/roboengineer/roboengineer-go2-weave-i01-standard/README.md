| Oracle | `none` — Harbor 0.23.0 oracle agent on a cloud CPU host, 2026-10-18, image efe-private:control-transfer-0.2.0: the reference controller (solution/, three feedback rounds) succeeded on 0/10 held-out cases, mean engineering score 0.00; nop 0. No full oracle: human review (PROTOCOL §4). No positive example yet. |
| Agent time budget | 14400 s; tokens: protocol default (docs/protocol/running.md "Official runs") |

## Task
Execute a predeclared body velocity command schedule to pass four alternating poles without contact; no global-position feedback.

## Difficulty
Infer transfer failures from video and noisy sensors across bounded adaptation rounds.

## Reference solution
Harbor 0.23.0 oracle agent on a cloud CPU host, 2026-10-18, image efe-private:control-transfer-0.2.0: the reference controller (solution/, three feedback rounds) succeeded on 0/10 held-out cases, mean engineering score 0.00; nop 0. No full oracle: human review (PROTOCOL §4). No positive example yet.

## Verification
Frozen development and held-out banks, data-only deployment, fresh-process state hashes, separate no-network verifier. All numeric scores and physical outcomes are operator-only until submission closes.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 2 | 6 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 6 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | — |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: not needed.

### Notes
A simulated port of published quadruped performance tasks, not a hardware calibration; MuJoCo contacts differ from other simulators.
