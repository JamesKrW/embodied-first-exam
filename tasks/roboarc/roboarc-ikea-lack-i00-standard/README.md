## Task
IKEA LACK side table (AA-207276-4, four legs) in plain MuJoCo 3.14.0 (CPU, float64) with two 7-DoF Franka Panda arms, each with the MuJoCo Menagerie Panda hand (two-finger, tendon-coupled), through the robot service (eai-standard/2.4; 2.1 / 2.2
requests are served unchanged): RGB from four ALOHA-style cameras (optional depth), proprioception, `joint_position`
chunks, stateless kinematics, every pose in the robot's frame; no reset and no privileged state. Screw all four legs onto the four threaded studs of the tabletop.

## Difficulty
The privileged twin's bimanual assembly with physical grasps, from cameras and proprioception only, in one episode
without reset; 16-D actuator action at 400 Hz, joint targets within the robot's joint
velocity limits (joints 1-4 2.175 rad/s, joints 5-7 2.61 rad/s, the hand command 318.75 units/s). The reference needs 67697 control steps (169.24 s of simulated
time).

## Reference solution
`solution/solve.sh` runs `solution/oracle_replay.py`: it submits the control steps of `solution/oracle_actions.npz` through
the client as `joint_position` chunks of 10 s, `hold`, one control step per row, as float64 (the client's transport;
`Robot.submit` sends float32), so the service executes exactly those rows. The rows are the privileged twin's reference trajectory brought within the joint-speed rule (method `clamp`: target glitches of one to a few control steps, which the servos never followed, replaced by the running median (0 rows); then clamp, then `--grip wait`: each row whose gripper command steps faster than the hand's speed held until the slewed hand reaches it (4000 control steps added, 67697 in all)),
so the service's speed limiter never has to act (`n_clipped` 0).

## Verification
The sim service (`environment/sim/server.py`) steps the scene's own runtime (`rcb_ikea.Session.step`: `data.ctrl[:] =
row; S.step(4)`), applies the joint-speed rule, evaluates the grader's terminal rules (`rcb_ikea.Session.status()`:
success.py, released, at rest, no breakdown) after every call and, when they hold, `Session.final_check()` (the same after
a 1.0 s hold of the last row), both on a snapshot restored bit-exactly afterwards, ends the episode at the first settled
success or at a breakdown, and journals every executed control step; at the end it writes
`/data/trajectory.npz` (all executed control steps, float64: the replayable deliverable) and the final state hash; an
episode that ends otherwise (timeout) is judged as it stands by the same two checks. Before the episode the service checks
the scene file by file against `runtime_binding.json` and by its initial-state hash (`instance_mismatch`, infrastructure).
The verifier (`tests/grade.py`, separate sandbox, no network, the shared client base) transcribes `final.json`: pass iff
the live episode succeeded (`graded_by_live` 1, `replays` 0). No grading replay runs.

Earlier validation, under the former grading by two verifier replays (not re-run under the live grading): Harbor checks on a Ryzen 9 7950X / RTX 4090 workstation (shared, heavily loaded: load 40-90), Harbor 0.23.0, image 0.3.1 sha256:b9552184c2de / -sim 0.4.1 (Nyx RGB, 54694704aa75); graded by the live episode (2026-10-18): `oracle` scored 1 (the hand-slew reference: live settled success at control step 67697 (17 calls), live end hash 684fe3c488e0 = the reference's, video 1; live service time 1277 s on the loaded host); `nop` scored 0 (video 1).

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Grasping | physical (finger friction), no assist |
| Success rule | the scene's `success.py` + the terminal rules (released, at rest, no breakdown), on the live episode: after every call and at its end, at the last row and again after a 1.0 s hold of it (on a copy) |
| Frame | every pose the agent gets or gives is in the robot frame: origin at the left arm's base link, +z up (`spec.world`); the scene's own world frame never leaves the sim service |
| Speed rule | targets within the robot's real limits (joints 1-4 2.175 rad/s, joints 5-7 2.61 rad/s, the hand command 318.75 units/s; the table and its sources: `rcb_ikea.JOINT_SPEED_LIMITS_RAD_S` / `GRIPPER_WIDTH_SPEED_M_S`), clamped per control step, as the privileged twin's Session; faster rows take the control steps they need (`meta.clipped`), as RoboARC's rule |
| Cameras | `cam_high`, `cam_low` (static), `cam_left_wrist`, `cam_right_wrist` (on the hands); 848 x 480, fovy 58 deg; added at service start (`environment/sim/ikea_rig.py`, `rig.json`), the model is unchanged; RGB: Nyx, RoboARC's renderer and look (path tracer, 32 spp, denoised; studio HDRI and point lights; `environment/sim/ikea_nyx.py` with RoboARC's `nyx_direct.py`); depth: MuJoCo's raster; on the sidecar's GPU |
| Video | `/data/live.mp4` (cam_high, 10 frames per simulated second, recorded during the live episode), copied to the verifier logs; never affects the verdict |
| Scene | `/opt/ikea/scenes/lack/` in the images; digest `e669195502062a45…` |
| Initial state | sha256 `0bddce57c9bcaf34…` of the mjSTATE_INTEGRATION vector |

### Budget
The wall clock only, the privileged twin's cutoff (PROTOCOL H.7): `[agent] timeout_sec` = 10800 s. The service
counts the same limit from the agent's first request (`spec.budget.wall_clock_s`, `meta.time_left_s`) and ends the
episode with reason `timeout` when it runs out; that count never runs out before Harbor's.

### Deviations
- `ee_pose` is not offered (only `joint_position`, the scene's actuator layout); `/kinematics` gives FK / IK.
- Graded by the live episode (the settled check on the live simulator); no grading replay, in the sidecar or the
  verifier.

### Goal
Screw all four legs onto the four threaded studs of the tabletop.

### Success requirements
- The tabletop lies studs up. Each leg (nut end down) is screwed onto a stud; any leg may go on any stud, one leg per stud.
- Every leg is seated and latched on a distinct stud, and at the end, measured in the tabletop frame: the leg origin is 0 to 12 mm above the slab top, within 20 mm laterally of its stud, and the leg axis is within 10 degrees of the tabletop axis.

The benchmark's terminal rules, the same in every IKEA MuJoCo task, come on top of these requirements. When your rows end: (1) the requirements above hold; (2) the parts are released: no robot link touches any part; (3) every part is at rest: at most 0.01 m/s and 0.05 rad/s; (4) the simulation never broke down: no non-finite state, no MuJoCo BADQACC / BADQPOS / BADQVEL warning, no contact of a part deeper than 10 mm, at any time. The grader then holds your last row for 1.0 s more and requires (1)-(4) again at its end.

### Mechanism
The M16 x 2 right-hand threads are exact convex pieces: a leg advances only by being turned (about six turns from first thread contact to the seat). A leg that is seated on a vacant stud and descends slower than 0.05 m/s is latched to the tabletop at its current pose (a weld, the source's fixed joint).
