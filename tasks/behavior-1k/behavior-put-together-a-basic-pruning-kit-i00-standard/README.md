| Oracle | `none` — No reference solution and no verified positive example yet: BEHAVIOR-1K ships no expert or planner that replays on this frozen instance, and no model trial has solved this task. Solvable by a human with this robot: the 2026 BEHAVIOR Challenge publishes 200 teleoperated demonstrations of this activity on the R1Pro in this scene model (375 s on average); demonstration video (448 s): https://www.youtube.com/embed/UmGRVx-OCac (challenge task list https://behavior.stanford.edu/challenge/tasks/index.html). Supplementary task (added 2026-10-04); human review per family (protocol §4). |

## Task
Standard-mode twin of `behavior-put-together-a-basic-pruning-kit-i00-privileged` on the same frozen instance (2026 BEHAVIOR Challenge public_test instance 301): In the garage, put the pruner and the shears, which lie on the floor, inside the toolbox, which also stands on the floor, and close the toolbox; the toolbox stays on the floor.

## Difficulty
Same scene, frozen instance and success rule as `behavior-put-together-a-basic-pruning-kit-i00-privileged` (see its Difficulty). In standard mode the agent has no reset, no privileged state and no planning primitives: it sees the robot's cameras (RGB, depth on request) and its proprioception only, acts through the client, and gets one episode.

## Reference solution
None (`oracle = "none"`): no reference solution was written, and no positive example has been graded by this verifier yet. Evidence that the task is solvable: the 2026 BEHAVIOR Challenge's human teleoperation demonstrations of this activity on the R1Pro (`task.toml` `oracle_evidence`).

## Verification
`success` = the live episode's success, judged by the sim sidecar (graded live, no replay: 2026-10-17): the success
rule (the BDDL goal held 1 s, released and at rest) at every control step; when the agent's episode is still running at
its end, the sidecar holds the robot still for up to 5 s on the live simulator after the agent's container is stopped
and a goal that settles there counts (`settled_success`). The frozen start is checked when the sidecar builds the scene,
before the agent is served. The crash-recovery fields (`sim_startups`, `resumes`, `resume_state_mismatch`) are
reported; the video (`/logs/verifier/live.mp4`) is recorded during the episode (a video-only render, `replay.mp4`, only
when it is missing) and never decides anything. `infra_error` = 1 (no verdict on the agent) when `final.json` is
missing, unreadable or not finalized, the service never ended the episode, it gave up after crashes not all inside the
agent's calls, or the frozen start did not rebuild (`instance_mismatch`).

No oracle and no verified positive example: the family is reviewed by a maintainer (PROTOCOL §2.7) in the pull request that adds it, on the official human demonstrations and a `nop` run per mode; until a positive example scores 1, its results are reported separately from the tasks with a verified solution (PROTOCOL §7, open item 4).

## Resources
Each number is an upper bound for one container; docs/protocol/README.md §6 says where each is set and what enforces it.

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 8 | 24 GiB | 16384 | no GPU | 20 GiB |
| `sim` | 12 | 50 GiB | 16384 | 16 GiB | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 8 | 24 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 20 GiB |

- GPU: an RTX-class NVIDIA GPU (ray-tracing cores), one of the models in `gpu_types`: L40S, L40, L4, RTX 4090, RTX 6000 Ada, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: L40S 48GB / L4 24GB / RTX 4090 24GB.
- Measured: GPU memory 8.3-9.0 GB with RCB_TEXTURE_BUDGET=0.1, the tasks' default (a per-container sampler every 30 s, trials on 14 GPU hosts); CPU 6-9 cores per trial; 13-16 GB of memory per Isaac process
- Measured (caps): GPU memory (the sim service): 9.0 GiB with RCB_TEXTURE_BUDGET=0.1, the tasks' default (trials without the budget reached 29.0 GiB on 48 GB cards) -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4), at least 16 GiB for Isaac Sim: 16 GiB; processes and disk: defaults, not measured

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Protocol | `eai-standard/2.2`: RGB-D + proprioception through the client; no reset, no object poses, no success predicate |
| Action space | `submit` chunks of `joint_position` (25, streamed at the 30 Hz control rate with the agent's `dt`; base entries are per-step targets) or of `ee_pose` (16, both end effectors, cuRobo IK per row); `observe` frames or a watch window; binary RCB1 responses |
| Crash recovery | `restart: on-failure:6`; the service journals every control step (`journal.f64`) and resumes the same episode after a crash (resume class `approx`, docs/protocol/standard_mode.md §13.1); startup watchdog `RCB_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_S` = 1800 s |
| Dataset | the licensed BEHAVIOR dataset, mounted read-only into the sidecar from `$RCB_BEHAVIOR_DATA` (a precondition) |
| Budget | the agent's time is the `Agent time budget` row (the number is this task's `[agent] timeout_sec`; tasks/behavior-1k/README.md) |
| Collect hook time | 23400 s: the episode end (up to 2 h through a resume, with the 5 s settle window) + a video-only render after the verdict, only when the live video is missing (up to 4 h) + 30 min |

### Sidecar and grading
The agent gets only the `eai-standard/2.2` client (docs/protocol/standard_mode.md); the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar
(`environment/docker-compose.yaml`: GPU on the sidecar, the licensed dataset mounted read-only at `/data`, the service's own
record in `/out`), which owns the scene, judges the episode and records it as a (T, 25) trajectory and a video. The
collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the episode (the settle window on the live simulator when it was still
running), lets the service exit and writes `final.json` from the live result; nothing replays the episode. The
verifier runs in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`) over those artifacts.
