Recorded Harbor oracle run (laptop, a pre-v1.0 version): 2026-09-25 behavior-putting-shoes-on-rack-i__XB2NUoX (job behavior-putting-shoes-on-rack-i00-limited-oracle-0925-015349) scored 1 with live_matches_replay 1 (6283 control steps), 1 of 1. The sim service, collect hook, grader and oracle client changed since (crash recovery); not re-run on this version (static validation only). |

## Task
Standard-mode twin of `behavior-putting-shoes-on-rack-i00-privileged` on the same frozen instance (2026 BEHAVIOR Challenge public_test instance 301): Put both pairs of shoes on the hall tree in the corridor.

## Difficulty
Same scene, frozen instance and success rule as `behavior-putting-shoes-on-rack-i00-privileged` (see its Difficulty). In standard mode the agent has no reset, no privileged state and no planning primitives: it sees the robot's cameras (RGB, depth on request) and its proprioception only, acts through the client, and gets one episode.

## Reference solution
`solution/`: streams the privileged oracle's joint targets (one row per control step, `hold`) as `joint_position` chunks through the client; it uses no privileged information at run time, and after a service crash it waits for the resumed episode and continues from the control step it reached (`on_service_error`).

## Verification
`success` = the live episode's success, judged by the sim sidecar (graded live, no replay: 2026-10-17): the success
rule (the BDDL goal held 1 s, released and at rest) at every control step; when the agent's episode is still running at
its end, the sidecar holds the robot still for up to 5 s on the live simulator after the agent's container is stopped
and a goal that settles there counts (`settled_success`). The frozen start is checked when the sidecar builds the scene,
before the agent is served. The crash-recovery fields (`sim_startups`, `resumes`, `resume_state_mismatch`) are
reported; the video (`/logs/verifier/live.mp4`) is recorded during the episode (a video-only render, `replay.mp4`, only
when it is missing) and never decides anything. `infra_error` = 1 (no verdict on the agent) when `final.json` is
missing, unreadable or not finalized, the service never ended the episode, it gave up after crashes not all inside the
agent's calls, or the frozen start did not rebuild (`instance_mismatch`).

Oracle `partial`: the reference solution scored 1 on earlier versions of this task (`task.toml` `oracle_evidence`) and was not re-run on this one; the family is reviewed by a maintainer (PROTOCOL §4) in the pull request that adds it.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 8 | 24 GiB | 8192 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 12 | 32 GiB | 2048 | 16 GiB | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 8 | 24 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 10 GiB |

- GPU: an RTX-class NVIDIA GPU (ray-tracing cores), one of the models in `gpu_types`: L40S, L40, L4, RTX 4090, RTX 6000 Ada, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: L40S 48GB / L4 24GB / RTX 4090 24GB.
- Measured: GPU memory 8.3-9.0 GB with RCB_TEXTURE_BUDGET=0.1, the tasks' default (a per-container sampler every 30 s, trials on 14 GPU hosts); CPU 6-9 cores per trial; 13-16 GB of memory per Isaac process
- Measured (caps): GPU memory (the sim service): 9.0 GiB with RCB_TEXTURE_BUDGET=0.1, the tasks' default (trials without the budget reached 29.0 GiB on 48 GB cards) -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4), at least 16 GiB for Isaac Sim: 16 GiB; per-container peaks in 132 past trials: the agent's container memory 19.4 GiB, 2089 threads, CPU at its cap (8), disk 1.7 GiB; the sim service memory 21.0 GiB, 692 threads, CPU at its cap (12), GPU memory 10.6 GiB

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Protocol | `eai-standard/2.2`: RGB-D + proprioception through the client; no reset, no object poses, no success predicate |
| Action space | `submit` chunks of `joint_position` (25, streamed at the 30 Hz control rate with the agent's `dt`; base entries are per-step targets) or of `ee_pose` (16, both end effectors, cuRobo IK per row); `observe` frames or a watch window; binary RCB1 responses |
| Crash recovery | `restart: on-failure:6`; the service journals every control step (`journal.f64`) and resumes the same episode after a crash (resume class `approx`, docs/protocol/standard_mode.md §13.1); startup watchdog `RCB_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_S` = 1800 s |
| Dataset | the licensed BEHAVIOR dataset, mounted read-only into the sidecar from `$RCB_BEHAVIOR_DATA` (a precondition) |
| Budget | the agent's time is the `Agent time budget` row (the number is this task's `[agent] timeout_sec`; tasks/behavior-1k/README.md) |
| Collect hook time | 23400 s: the episode end (up to 2 h through a resume, with the 5 s settle window) + a video-only render after the verdict, only when the live video is missing (up to 4 h) + 30 min |

### Sidecar and grading
The agent gets only the `eai-standard/2.2` client (docs/protocol/standard_mode.md); the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar
(`environment/docker-compose.yaml`: GPU on the sidecar, the licensed dataset mounted read-only at `/data`, the service's own
record in `/out`), which owns the scene, judges the episode and records it as a (T, 25) trajectory and a video. The
collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the episode (the settle window on the live simulator when it was still
running), lets the service exit and writes `final.json` from the live result; nothing replays the episode. The
verifier runs in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`) over those artifacts.
