## Task
Push the shapes onto their pads (Unitree G1, fixed pelvis, Pink IK). EmbodiedSWE's `puzzle.push_shapes.g1.pink_ik` task (robobench at commit `67f44e8a2ca5`), privileged mode, with a program as the
deliverable: `solution/solve.py` exposing `solve(env)`.

## Difficulty
Non-prehensile manipulation with a humanoid upper body: push three flat shaped blocks across a board, each starting rotated, until each drops into the cutout of its own shape, without lifting them, using absolute wrist poses (Pink IK).

## Reference solution
None in the repository (`oracle = "none"`). No scripted reference has been written for this scene yet.

## Verification
`tests/grade.py` with EmbodiedSWE's grader for this scene, `tests/grader/push_shapes.py`, on the frozen instance (seed 0); the procedure (candidates, sandbox, 30-minute limit, selection, video) is the benchmark's, tasks/embodiedswe/README.md "Grading".

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).
