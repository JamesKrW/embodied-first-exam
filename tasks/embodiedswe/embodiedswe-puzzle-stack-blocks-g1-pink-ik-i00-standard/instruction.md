# Stack the blocks (Unitree G1, fixed pelvis, Pink IK) — standard mode

The task of `embodiedswe-puzzle-stack-blocks-g1-pink-ik-i00-privileged`, on the same frozen scene. You drive a Unitree G1 humanoid with three-finger hands, its pelvis fixed, its arms and waist under EmbodiedSWE's Pink IK, as if it were real hardware: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open, and you get its client, one episode and no reset. The client's docstring is its manual (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`); `r.spec()` gives the numbers.

## The task
4 coloured wooden blocks (45 mm cubes) lie scattered flat on a work table, beside a marked square pad. Goal: stack all 4 blocks into a single upright tower centred on the pad — one block squarely on top of the next, faces level, so the finished tower stands 4 blocks high and stays standing. A block placed off-centre enough to overhang, set down crooked, or left off the pad does not count toward the tower.

Success, exactly: the four 45 mm blocks form one tower on the dark square pad with exactly one block in each of the four levels: every block's centre is within 30 mm horizontally of the pad centre, its centre height is within 20 mm of 0.7225 m + 0.045 m x its level (levels 0-3, i.e. 0.7225 / 0.7675 / 0.8125 / 0.8575 m; table top 0.70 m), one of its faces is level within 25 deg (some cube axis within 25 deg of vertical), and every block moves slower than 0.05 m/s. Not true at the start (blocks scattered flat behind the pad).

## This robot
- Action: `ee_pose` only, 28 values: the world poses of the left and right `wrist_yaw_link` (`x y z qw qx qy qz` each), then 14 hand joint targets (rad). Rows are streamed at the 60 Hz control rate with your `dt`; `spec["action_types"]["ee_pose"]` has the layout, the controller and the joint limits. Coordinates are the simulator's world frame (metres, z up; `spec["world"]`).
- Cameras (RGB 640×480, depth on request): `overview` (static) and `head` (on the torso, where the real G1 carries its depth camera). One call returns at most 240 images (`max_frames_per_call`, PROTOCOL §3 "Images per call": cameras × the frames captured, the first, one every round(60 / `video_fps`) control steps and the last, a per-frame depth one more image; `video="none"` captures only the first and the last); a larger request is refused (400) before anything runs. A call that names no cameras gets `overview`, `head` at 3 frames per second, so every call up to `max_chunk_s` / `max_watch_s` fits.
- The episode ends after the first call at whose end the success condition holds (judged on the live simulator), when your time is up, on a simulator error, or after 400,000 control steps (1.9 h of simulated time, reason `step_guard`); it is graded as it stands then. Simulated time advances only inside your calls.
- The service answers one request at a time: while a long call runs, every other request waits, so a client-side timeout means "busy", not "crashed".
- Leave your scripts in `/app/output/` for the record.

## This run: unlimited resets, save and load

This run changes the reset budget and adds two calls. This section overrides anything above, and anything in `/spec`,
that says there is no reset, one episode only, or fewer resets.

- You have 1000 resets (`spec()["budget"]["reset"]` is 1000): in practice as many as your time allows.
- `POST /reset` on the same base URL as your other calls (`http://sim:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`), with a JSON body
  such as `{"cameras": []}` (in Python, for example `requests.post(base + "/reset", json={"cameras": []})`; the
  client's `_post("/reset", {"cameras": []}, [], 60)` where it has no `reset()`). It abandons the running episode, or
  follows one that has ended (a failure or a fall included), and starts a new episode from the same starting state.
  The answer carries the new episode's first frames; `meta` and `GET /status` add `episode`, `resets_left`, `saves`,
  `loads` and `control_steps_total`.
- Where `/spec` has `state_ops`, two more calls exist (its text is the full rule):
  - `POST /save_state` with `{}` stores the current state in the service and answers JSON
    `{"handle": "s1", "step": ...}`. The handle is all you get, never the state's contents.
  - `POST /load_state` with `{"handle": "s1", "cameras": []}` restores a state saved earlier in this run and starts a
    new episode there; it answers as `/reset` does. At most 32 handles are kept (the least recently used one is
    dropped). Saves and loads do not use up resets.
  Where `/spec` has no `state_ops`, this task offers resets only.
- Your time keeps running across resets and loads (in standard-realtime the robot's clock pauses after a reset or a
  load until your next command).
- Only the last episode is graded: from the starting state, or for a loaded episode the path that led to the saved
  state followed by what you did after the load. The success rule is checked again from your next command on. A
  success still ends the run: no reset, save or load after it.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resources
Your container: **8 CPUs**, **24 GiB of memory**, **1024 processes and threads** and **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`). Your container has no GPU. The simulator runs in its own container and does not count against these. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 14400 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).
