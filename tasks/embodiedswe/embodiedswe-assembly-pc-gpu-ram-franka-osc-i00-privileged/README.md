## Task
Install a graphics card and two RAM sticks (Franka, operational-space control). EmbodiedSWE's `assembly.pc_gpu_ram.franka.osc` task (robobench at commit `67f44e8a2ca5`), privileged mode, with a program as the
deliverable: `solution/solve.py` exposing `solve(env)`.

## Difficulty
Three sequential insertions in one case: the graphics card (slide-under-the-rear-panel then press) and two RAM sticks into the correct dual-channel slots, each pressed fully home.

## Reference solution
None in the repository (`oracle = "none"`). No scripted reference has been written for this scene yet.

## Verification
`tests/grade.py` with EmbodiedSWE's grader for this scene, `tests/grader/pc_gpu_ram_assembly.py`, on the frozen instance (seed 0); the procedure (candidates, sandbox, 30-minute limit, selection, video) is the benchmark's, tasks/embodiedswe/README.md "Grading".

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 8 | 29 GiB | 16384 | 16 GiB | 10 GiB |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | 16 GiB | no cap |

- GPU: an RTX-class NVIDIA GPU (ray-tracing cores), one of the models in `gpu_types`: L40S, L40, L4, RTX 4090, RTX 6000 Ada, held by `main`.
- Recommended GPU: L40S 48GB / L4 24GB / RTX 4090 24GB.
