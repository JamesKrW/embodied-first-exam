# Draw and dose liquid with a syringe (two Frankas, operational-space control) — standard mode

The task of `embodiedswe-puzzle-syringe-bimanual-franka-osc-i00-privileged`, on the same frozen scene. You drive two Franka Panda arms with parallel grippers, each under EmbodiedSWE's operational-space (torque) controller, as if it were real hardware: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open, and you get its client, one episode and no reset. The client's docstring is its manual (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`); `r.spec()` gives the numbers.

## The task
On the top shelf of a medical cart: a large syringe LYING FLAT (a scanned model — translucent barrel with graduation marks and finger flanges, a plunger with a thumb plate, travel 0.12 m = its full capacity, and a luer nozzle at the tip), a rack of three GLASS TEST TUBES, and a wide RESERVOIR beaker of water (its blue level visibly drops as liquid is drawn). The cart's lower shelf holds packaged syringes and a basin — scenery only.
Liquid moves with the plunger, but ONLY while the syringe is roughly upright with the nozzle tip seated on a mouth: hovering within 6 mm laterally and 12 mm above the rim. Pulling the plunger while seated on the reservoir draws liquid; pushing it dispenses into whichever tube the tip is seated on — anywhere else the liquid is WASTED. Tubes never un-fill: a tube pushed past its band is ruined for the episode (the reservoir can be re-drawn from, but over-dispensing cannot be undone). The water is VISIBLE: a blue column inside the translucent barrel shows the drawn liquid, and each tube fills with a blue column as it receives its dose. The plunger has deliberate friction: push/pull it slowly and steadily.
Goal: draw a full load (>= 95% of capacity, tip seated in the reservoir), dispense between 23% and 43% of capacity into EACH of the three tubes, then lay the syringe back down at its spot on the shelf.

Success, exactly: (1) at some moment the barrel held at least 95% of capacity (liquid gained only from plunger draw while the tip was seated on the reservoir) while the tip was seated on the reservoir beaker; (2) each of the three test tubes has received between 23% and 43% of capacity (0.12 m stroke), counting only plunger pushes made while the tip was seated on that tube's mouth; (3) now the syringe lies at its starting spot on the shelf: barrel centre within 60 mm horizontally of its start position, barrel axis within about 20.5 deg of horizontal (|vertical component| < 0.35), barrel centre within 80 mm of the shelf top height, moving slower than 0.05 m/s. 'Seated' = nozzle tip within 6 mm horizontally of the mouth centre, from 12 mm below to 12 mm above its rim, plunger end up with the barrel within ~31.8 deg of vertical, counted for 10 substeps after it last held. Not true at the start.

## This robot
- Action: `ee_pose` only, 18 values: left arm then right arm, each the world pose of its `panda_hand` (`x y z qw qx qy qz`) and its two finger position targets (m, 0 closed, 0.04 open). Rows are streamed at the 15 Hz control rate with your `dt`; `spec["action_types"]["ee_pose"]` has the layout, the controller and the joint limits. Coordinates are the simulator's world frame (metres, z up; `spec["world"]`).
- Cameras (RGB 640×480, depth on request): `overview` (static), `left_wrist` (on the left hand), and `right_wrist` (on the right hand). One call returns at most 240 images (`max_frames_per_call`, PROTOCOL §3 "Images per call": cameras × the frames captured, the first, one every round(15 / `video_fps`) control steps and the last, a per-frame depth one more image; `video="none"` captures only the first and the last); a larger request is refused (400) before anything runs. A call that names no cameras gets `overview`, `left_wrist`, `right_wrist` at 2 frames per second, so every call up to `max_chunk_s` / `max_watch_s` fits.
- The episode ends after the first call at whose end the success condition holds (judged on the live simulator), when your time is up, on a simulator error, or after 400,000 control steps (7.4 h of simulated time, reason `step_guard`); it is graded as it stands then. Simulated time advances only inside your calls.
- The service answers one request at a time: while a long call runs, every other request waits, so a client-side timeout means "busy", not "crashed".
- Leave your scripts in `/app/output/` for the record.

## This run: unlimited resets, save and load

This run changes the reset budget and adds two calls. This section overrides anything above, and anything in `/spec`,
that says there is no reset, one episode only, or fewer resets.

- You have 1000 resets (`spec()["budget"]["reset"]` is 1000): in practice as many as your time allows.
- `POST /reset` on the same base URL as your other calls (`http://sim:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`), with a JSON body
  such as `{"cameras": []}` (in Python, for example `requests.post(base + "/reset", json={"cameras": []})`; the
  client's `_post("/reset", {"cameras": []}, [], 60)` where it has no `reset()`). It abandons the running episode, or
  follows one that has ended (a failure or a fall included), and starts a new episode from the same starting state.
  The answer carries the new episode's first frames; `meta` and `GET /status` add `episode`, `resets_left`, `saves`,
  `loads` and `control_steps_total`.
- Where `/spec` has `state_ops`, two more calls exist (its text is the full rule):
  - `POST /save_state` with `{}` stores the current state in the service and answers JSON
    `{"handle": "s1", "step": ...}`. The handle is all you get, never the state's contents.
  - `POST /load_state` with `{"handle": "s1", "cameras": []}` restores a state saved earlier in this run and starts a
    new episode there; it answers as `/reset` does. At most 32 handles are kept (the least recently used one is
    dropped). Saves and loads do not use up resets.
  Where `/spec` has no `state_ops`, this task offers resets only.
- Your time keeps running across resets and loads (in standard-realtime the robot's clock pauses after a reset or a
  load until your next command).
- Only the last episode is graded: from the starting state, or for a loaded episode the path that led to the saved
  state followed by what you did after the load. The success rule is checked again from your next command on. A
  success still ends the run: no reset, save or load after it.

## This run: privileged state queries

This run lets you query the simulator's state. This section overrides anything above, and anything in `/spec`, that
says object poses or the scene's state are never given.

- `GET /state/entities` (on the same base URL as your other calls) lists what you can query:
  `{"frame": ..., "quaternion_order": ..., "entities": {name: {"kind": ..., "fields": {field: unit}}}}`. The
  kinds are `robot` (the robot's base or root), `robot_link` (a hand, a foot, an end effector), `object`,
  `articulation` (a door, a drawer, a faucet: its joints) and `scene_feature` (a zone, a line, a hazard, a canvas
  region). The list is fixed for the run.
- `POST /state/query` with `{"names": ["robot", ...], "fields": ["pos", "quat"]}` answers JSON
  `{"state": {name: {field: value}}, "control_steps": ..., "sim_time_s": ..., "state_queries": ...}` with the
  current values. `fields` is optional: without it you get every field of each name. In Python:
  `requests.post(base + "/state/query", json={"names": ["robot"]}).json()["state"]`.
  - The usual fields: `pos` [x, y, z] m, `quat` (in `quaternion_order`), `lin_vel` m/s, `ang_vel` rad/s,
    `height_above_ground` m, `joint_pos` / `joint_vel` {joint: value}, `size` [3] m (full extents), and `bbox`
    [[min x, y, z], [max x, y, z]] m. A task may add its own; each field's unit is in the list.
  - All values are in the world frame that `frame` describes.
  - A field that an entity does not have is left out of its entry.
  - An unknown name or field is a 400 that lists the valid ones.
- A query only reads. It takes no control step, and it does not advance or pause the clock. In standard-realtime it
  answers at the current simulation time while the robot keeps moving. It is served while the episode runs (409 after
  the episode ended). Queries are counted and recorded; they do not change the grading.
- Nothing else changes: the goal, the success rule and its thresholds are not given, and no answer says whether the
  task is done.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resources
Your container: **8 CPUs**, **24 GiB of memory**, **1024 processes and threads** and **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`). Your container has no GPU. The simulator runs in its own container and does not count against these. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 14400 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).
