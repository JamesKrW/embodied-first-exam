| Simulator / robot | `embodiedswe` / `unitree-g1-dex3` |
| Family / instance | `packing.clear_organic_objects.g1.pink_ik` / seed 0 |
| Oracle | `none` — No reference solution in the repository, and none written for this scene yet; the build, the start-state hash and a do-nothing run scoring 0 are checked. |

## Task
Sort the front-row items into the crate and onto the tray (Unitree G1, fixed pelvis, Pink IK). EmbodiedSWE's `packing.clear_organic_objects.g1.pink_ik` task (robobench at commit `67f44e8a2ca5`), privileged mode, with a program as the
deliverable: `solution/solve.py` exposing `solve(env)`.

## Difficulty
Sorting pick-and-place with three-finger hands on a crowded table: four small items are picked from the front row and placed in two different containers while the rest of the table stays undisturbed.

## Reference solution
None in the repository (`oracle = "none"`). No scripted reference has been written for this scene yet.

## Verification
`tests/grade.py` with EmbodiedSWE's grader for this scene, `tests/grader/clear_organic_objects.py`, on the frozen instance (seed 0); the procedure (candidates, sandbox, 30-minute limit, selection, video) is the benchmark's, tasks/embodiedswe/README.md "Grading".

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
