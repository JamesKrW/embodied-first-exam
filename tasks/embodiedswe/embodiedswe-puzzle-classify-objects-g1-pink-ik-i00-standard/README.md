| Agent time budget | 14400 s; tokens: protocol default (docs/protocol/running.md "Official runs") |

## Task
Sort the blocks by colour (Unitree G1, fixed pelvis, Pink IK): the scene, frozen instance and success predicate of `embodiedswe-puzzle-classify-objects-g1-pink-ik-i00-privileged`, with a Unitree G1 humanoid with three-finger hands, its pelvis fixed, its arms and waist under EmbodiedSWE's Pink IK, in standard mode
(tasks/embodiedswe/README.md "Standard mode").

## Difficulty
That of the privileged twin, from camera images, depth and proprioception only: no resets, no object poses, no success predicate.

## Reference solution
None (`oracle = "none"`): no reference solution has been recorded through the standard API.

## Verification
Graded by the live episode: `tests/grade.py` reads the service's `final.json` (EmbodiedSWE's grader for this scene,
`environment/sim/grader/classify_objects.py`, on the live state); tasks/embodiedswe/README.md "Standard mode".

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 8 | 24 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 8 | 24 GiB | 2048 | 18 GiB | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 8 | 24 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 10 GiB |

- GPU: an RTX-class NVIDIA GPU (ray-tracing cores), one of the models in `gpu_types`: L40S, L40, L4, RTX 4090, RTX 6000 Ada, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: L40S 48GB / L4 24GB / RTX 4090 24GB.
