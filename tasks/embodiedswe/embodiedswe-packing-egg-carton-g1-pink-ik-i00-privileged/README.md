## Task
Put three eggs in the carton and close the lid (Unitree G1, fixed pelvis, Pink IK). EmbodiedSWE's `packing.egg_carton.g1.pink_ik` task (robobench at commit `67f44e8a2ca5`), privileged mode, with a program as the
deliverable: `solution/solve.py` exposing `solve(env)`.

## Difficulty
Dexterous pick-and-place with a three-finger hand: eggs lying on their sides must be picked, turned upright and settled in three distinct pockets without disturbing their neighbours, then the hinged lid pushed closed.

## Reference solution
None in the repository (`oracle = "none"`). No scripted reference has been written for this scene yet.

## Verification
`tests/grade.py` with EmbodiedSWE's grader for this scene, `tests/grader/egg_carton.py`, on the frozen instance (seed 0); the procedure (candidates, sandbox, 30-minute limit, selection, video) is the benchmark's, tasks/embodiedswe/README.md "Grading".

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).
