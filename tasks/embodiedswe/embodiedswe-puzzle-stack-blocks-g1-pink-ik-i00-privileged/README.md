## Task
Stack the blocks (Unitree G1, fixed pelvis, Pink IK). EmbodiedSWE's `puzzle.stack_blocks.g1.pink_ik` task (robobench at commit `67f44e8a2ca5`), privileged mode, with a program as the
deliverable: `solution/solve.py` exposing `solve(env)`.

## Difficulty
Bimanual-capable humanoid upper body with three-finger hands driven by absolute wrist poses (Pink IK): grasping and placing blocks precisely enough to build a stable tower.

## Reference solution
None in the repository (`oracle = "none"`). A scripted reference `solve()` is kept outside the repository (internal only).

## Verification
`tests/grade.py` with EmbodiedSWE's grader for this scene, `tests/grader/stack_blocks.py`, on the frozen instance (seed 0); the procedure (candidates, sandbox, 30-minute limit, selection, video) is the benchmark's, tasks/embodiedswe/README.md "Grading".

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
